*I put code for week10 quiz code in sketch.js in root directory on week 10 before due time, and in order to keep the time record, I have to set a another new document for the Creative Coding Major project. So if just clicking on "go live", it may shows the wk10 quiz. 【Please see the "YZHA9441_Creative Coding Major Project" file!】 Thank you so much!
